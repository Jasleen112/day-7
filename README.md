# day-7
In my seventh day  i studied about network,host,client,server,mac address,IP and its types,IP address and its types.

WHAT ARE NETWORK?
Network in computers means a group of connected computers and devices that can share information and resources like files,internet,printers etc.

USES: Sharing files,acessing internet,sending emails,online gaming

WHAI IS HOST?
A host is any device(like a computer,mobile phone or printer) that is connected to a network and has its own IP address.
EXAMPLE:A computer connected to wifi,A smartphone using mobile data,A server on the internet.

Every host has a unique IP address.Host can be client or servers.Host can store,send,or recieve data.

WHAT ARE IOT(INTERNET OF THINGS)?
IoT means a network of physical devices that are connected to the internet and can collect,share and exchange data without human help.

WHAT IS SERVER?
A Server is a powerful computer or system that provides services,data or resources to other computers over a network.

MAC ADDRESSES:It stands for Media Access Control Address.It is a unique physical address given to every device's network card(NIC).A MAC address is like a permanent name tag for your                   device on a local network.

WHY MAC ADDRESS IS IMPORTANT:Device Identification Finds specific devices in a network Network Security aloows/block by MAC filtering Data Delivery Sends data to correct device on a LAN.

IP ADDRESS(INTERNET PROTOCOL):It is a set of rules that helps devices communicate over the internet by giving each device a unique address called an IP address.

TYPES OF IP ADDRESS(INTERNER PROTOCOL): IPv4(internet protocol version 4),IPv6(Internet Protocol Version 6).

WHAT IS DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)?
DNS is a system that translates website names into IP addresses that computers use to find each other on the internet.

HOW DNS WORKS?
1.You type a website name.
2.DNS finds its IP address.
3.Your device connects to the correct server.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNICAST,BROADCAST,MULTICAST:
UNICAST:One to one communication -> Single specific device -> Sending a message to a friend only.
BROADCAST:One-to-all communication -> All devices in the same network -> Router sending ARP to all devices.
MULTICAST:One-to-many communication -> A specific group of devices -> Live video stream to subscriber.

CLASSES OF IP ADDRESS:
Class A : Very big companies.
Class B: Medium companies.
Class C: Small companies.
Class D: Used for multicast(like online video streaming).
Class E:Not used by the public(only for experiments).

WHAT IS SUBNETTING?
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network (IP address block) into smaller parts called subnets.Subnetting is a method used in networking to divide one IP network into smaller,more manageable sub-networks to improve routing,security and performance.

WHY SUBNETTING IS USED?
1.To use IP addresses more efficiently.
2.To reduce network traffic.
3.To improve network security.
4.To simplify management of large network.

WHAT IS SUBNET MASK?
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used in IP addressing to separate the network portion and the host portion of an IP address.

COMMON SUBNET MASKS: CIDR NOTATION SUBNET MASK NUMBER OF HOST:/8 255.0.0.0 16 million+ /16 255.255.0.0.65,534/24 255.255.255.0 254/32 255.255.255.255.

It's my eigth day of training, i studied about Commands(ping,traceroute,IP config/IF config),testing Loopbavk with ping,what is DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

COMMANDS:
->ping : It is a command use to check if a computer or server is reachable on a network.ping means "Are you there?" and if the computer reply "Yes,i am here".
  Used for:to check internet connection,to test speed and delay between two devices,to find out if a website/server is working.
  SYNTAX:ping website name
WHAT IS LOOPBACK?
Loopback is a special IP address used to test your own computer's network system.

WHAT IS DHCP(DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL)?
It is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network settings(like gateway and DNS) to device in a network.

WHAT DHCP PROVIDES:IP address,subnet mask,default gateway,DNS server.

It's my nineth day of training i studied about introduction to HTML,how browser renders it,structure of HTML.

INTRODUCTION TO HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web.Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage.It defines the layout and structure of web content using elements.There are some tags in HTML.

                                 Tags                                 Description
                          <h1> to <h6>                       Headings (h1 = biggest)
                             <p>                             Paragraph
                             <a href="">                     Hyperlinks 
                             <img src="">                    Image
                             <ul> / <ol>                     Unordered/Ordered list
                             <li>                            List item
                             <br>                            Line break
                             <hr>                            Horizontal Line


HOW BROWSER RENDERS HTML?
1.Write HTML in a text editor(like notepad or VS code).
2.Save the file with .html extension (e.g. index.html)
3.
