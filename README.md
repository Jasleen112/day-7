In my seventh day  i studied about network,host,client,server,mac address,IP and its types,IP address and its types.

WHAT ARE NETWORK?
Network in computers means a group of connected computers and devices that can share information and resources like files,internet,printers etc.

USES: Sharing files,acessing internet,sending emails,online gaming

WHAI IS HOST?
A host is any device(like a computer,mobile phone or printer) that is connected to a network and has its own IP address.
EXAMPLE:A computer connected to wifi,A smartphone using mobile data,A server on the internet.

Every host has a unique IP address.Host can be client or servers.Host can store,send,or recieve data.

WHAT ARE IOT(INTERNET OF THINGS)?

WHAT IS SERVER?
A Server is a powerful computer or system that provides services,data or resources to other computers over a network.

MAC ADDRESSES:It stands for Media Access Control Address.It is a unique physical address given to every device's network card(NIC).A MAC address is like a permanent name tag for your                   device on a local network.

WHY MAC ADDRESS IS IMPORTANT:Device Identification Finds specific devices in a network Network Security aloows/block by MAC filtering Data Delivery Sends data to correct device on a LAN.

IP ADDRESS(INTERNET PROTOCOL):It is a set of rules that helps devices communicate over the internet by giving each device a unique address called an IP address.

TYPES OF IP ADDRESS(INTERNER PROTOCOL): IPv4(internet protocol version 4),IPv6(Internet Protocol Version 6).

WHAT IS DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)?
DNS is a system that translates website names into IP addresses that computers use to find each other on the internet.

HOW DNS WORKS?
1.You type a website name.
2.DNS finds its IP address.
3.Your device connects to the correct server.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNICAST,BROADCAST,MULTICAST:
UNICAST:One to one communication -> Single specific device -> Sending a message to a friend only.
BROADCAST:One-to-all communication -> All devices in the same network -> Router sending ARP to all devices.
MULTICAST:One-to-many communication -> A specific group of devices -> Live video stream to subscriber.

CLASSES OF IP ADDRESS:
